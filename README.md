# Anxiary
This project is an android application that records sound and exports it as an mp4 file, gets the accelerometer values every few seconds 
and stores them in a csv file, gets the location(longitude, latitude) every few seconds and stores it in a csv file, 
gets the spinners' values every few seconds and stores them in a csv file.
All four files are saved in the external storage of the device.
